I wrote myself a feed aggregator for my front page.

For me I run this as a standalone rails app, separately from my weblog.
You could do that (and redirect requests to / or /index.html with Apache or nginx/etc. )
Or you could integrate it into your own app. Up to you.
Because I want to use it as my home page, everything come to / or /index.html, using query parameters.

FEATURES
 * Will aggregate ANY feed, no matter how badly mangled by the creators, using FeedTools (I also tried feed_normalizer and simple rss but they're not as good)
 * Deals with slowness of downloading feeds, RSS, etc., and REXML by caching
 * Deals with need to recache using elegant http/cron periodic system
 * Display the feeds in a facebook-like news feed format, sorted by dated.
 * You can easily re-label the feeds, add and renew feeds (in the code)
 * Only 35 lines of controller code!

QUICK INSTRUCTIONS
 1. Go to config/config.yml
 2. Change secret to something you made up
 3. Make a cron job to regularly call /?recache=yes&secret=XXXXXXX
