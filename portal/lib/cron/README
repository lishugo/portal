Here's how to configure cron (must be on a unixy system):

1. Determine the absolute path to the PRODUCTION version of this directory
   (in other words, the directory that contains script update-feeds.sh).
   I will refer to that as UPDATE_SCRIPT_DIR.
   It could be for example: /disk2/home/simon/deployed-swc-portal/current/lib/cron
   To do this, go to this directory and type "pwd".

2. On the command line, edit your crontab file:
  % crontab -e

Add this line:

*/5 * * * * cd UPDATE_SCRIPT_DIR && ./update-feeds.sh  >update-feeds.log 2>&1

Save, and that's it. Every 5 minutes it will update the feeds. If you want it more often, change */5 to for example */1 (every one minute).

NOTE: The rails app will automatically pick up any new feeds you add in cron.

However, if you want to edit the display name of the feed, you have to do that in portal_controller.rb by editing the title_map variable.
