Here's how to configure cron (must be on a unixy system):

1. determine the path to this directory (and the script update-feeds.sh). I will refer to that as UPDATE_SCRIPT_DIR.

2. On the command line, edit your crontab file:
  % crontab -e

Add this line:

*/5 * * * * cd UPDATE_SCRIPT_DIR && ./update-feeds.sh  >update-feeds.log 2>&1

Save, and that's it. Every 5 minutes it will update the feeds. If you want it more often, change */5 to for example */1 (every one minute).
